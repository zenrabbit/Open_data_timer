1,tidy data sooner,Publishing promotes attention to more presentable and tidy data. ,efficiency and data improvements
2,more readable data,Data in a repository can be sourced remotely and iteratively read into R with replicable QA/WC workflows coded.,efficiency and data improvements
3,simplifies versioning and provenance,Data repositories support versioning. This ensures transparent and reproducible science. It also reduces confusion and promotes data integrity with cleaning and manipulations done from an established data asset.,efficiency and data improvements
4,data are archived and online,"Publishing in an established data repository is your insurance against lost data, accidental deletions, and for larger files supports distributed online and potentially collaborative analyses.",efficiency and data improvements
5,meta-data are described more clearly and enables easier paper writing,Writing meta-data develops clear thinking and supports effective description of the data and easier writing of methods and results if used in a publication. Different meta-data languages engender structural thinking and can also highlight gaps in data.,efficiency and data improvements
6,error checking,Individuals outside your team and authors can catch errors. Referees on papers or stakeholders can review data and meta-data and provide input on clarity.,efficiency and data improvements
7,sharing within team facilitated,Data can be stored online and a link shared versus various versions of files shared by email. ,efficiency and data improvements
8,establishes precedence,"Peer-review can take time. Similar to pre-prints, publish your data sooner can establish precedence and provide a citable object. More broadly, it accelerates collective discovery.",team science and societal good
9,increases likelihood of acceptance of a paper and supports open science,"It is likely that open data facilitates more rapid and positive peer review of a paper using those data. It demonstrates a commitment to open science, and the authors can also cite their own data in their paper if data are online in advance.",team science and societal good
10,attribution ,"Data are a valid research object and can be assigned a citable DOI. Authorship, land acknowledgement, and funding can be recognized. Most agencies require data publication and sooner is better.",team science and societal good
